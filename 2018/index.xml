      <description>Greetings all,
We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to announce that the Stevens Cyber Defense Team has met all the requirements to be considered a Step 4 Registered Student Organization (RSO) within Stevens! This means that we are a probationary RSO, and are given a budget and several other perks.
That&amp;rsquo;s not important to everyone else - what is important is that we now have the capability to run bigger and better meetings, and run them more often.</description>
